# Regularization
Applying L2 regularization and dropout techniques to a deep learning model designed to recommend positions for football players! The exercises involved implementing functions to compute the cost with L2 regularization, modify backpropagation to include L2 regularization, and incorporate dropout during forward and backward propagation. The goal was to prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
