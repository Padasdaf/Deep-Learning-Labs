# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application
In the "Convolutional Neural Networks: Application" exercises, tasks included building ConvNets for binary and multiclass classification using TensorFlow. First, a mood classifier was built with the Sequential API, using layers like zero padding, convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, max pooling, flattening, and a dense layer with sigmoid activation. Next, a sign language digit classifier was created with the Functional API, incorporating multiple convolutional layers, ReLU, max pooling, flattening, and a softmax-activated dense layer.
