# Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network
I implemented a model using an LSTM to generate music. I built a sequential model with an LSTM cell that processed musical inputs, generating predictions at each time step. I also created an inference model to sample sequences and predict the next note in a series. Finally, I used the model to generate music by sampling from the predicted output and converting it into a playable sequence. The overall task involved applying an LSTM network to a music generation task, resulting in the creation of jazz music based on learned patterns.
