# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
Implementing a logistic regression model to classify images as cat or non-cat! I started by initializing the parameters, then performed forward and backward propagation to compute the cost and gradients. Next, I optimized the parameters using gradient descent, created a function to predict outcomes, and combined everything into a single model. Finally, I evaluated the model's accuracy and tested it with my own image.
