# Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step
In the "Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step" exercises, I implemented forward and backward propagation for convolutional and pooling layers using NumPy. This included functions for zero padding (zero_pad), applying a filter (conv_single_step), performing convolution (conv_forward), pooling (pool_forward), and their respective backward passes (conv_backward and pool_backward). I also created masks for max pooling (create_mask_from_window) and distributed values for average pooling (distribute_value). These exercises deepened my understanding of hyperparameters like stride, padding, and the mechanics of convolutional neural networks.
