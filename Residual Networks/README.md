# Residual Networks
In these exercises, I built a deep convolutional network using ResNets in Keras. I implemented the identity block, allowing input to skip layers to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, and the convolutional block to align input and output dimensions. Then, I constructed the ResNet50 model by stacking these blocks across different stages, using convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations, and average pooling, learning to create deep networks with skip connections for easier training.
