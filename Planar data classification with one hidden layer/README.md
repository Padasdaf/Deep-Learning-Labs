# Planar data classification with one hidden layer
Building a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer! The tasks involved initializing parameters, implementing forward propagation with tanh and sigmoid activation functions, and computing the cross-entropy loss. I then performed backward propagation to calculate gradients, updated the parameters using gradient descent, and trained the model over multiple iterations. Finally, I implemented a prediction function to classify new examples, completing my first hands-on experience in building and training a neural network from scratch.
