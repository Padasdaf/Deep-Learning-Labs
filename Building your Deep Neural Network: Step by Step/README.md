# Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step
Implementing key functions for constructing and training a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers! This included initializing parameters, performing forward propagation with ReLU and sigmoid activations, calculating the cross-entropy cost, and executing backpropagation to compute gradients. I then applied gradient descent to update the network's weights and biases iteratively. These exercises equipped me with the skills to build and train a deep neural network, laying the groundwork for more complex tasks like image classification.
