# Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step
Implemented key functions for constructing and training a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers! This included initializing weights and biases, performing forward propagation with ReLU and sigmoid activations, computing the cross-entropy cost, and executing backpropagation to calculate gradients. Finally, I created a function to iteratively update the parameters using gradient descent, enabling the network to improve its performance over time.
