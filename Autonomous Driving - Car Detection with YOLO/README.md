# Autonomous Driving - Car Detection with YOLO
In this assignment on autonomous driving and car detection, I had to implement object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The tasks included processing the YOLO outputs by filtering boxes based on object and class confidence, using non-max suppression to eliminate redundant boxes, and applying the intersection over union (IoU) to calculate overlap between bounding boxes. These steps helped increase accuracy and enabled precise detection of objects within images. The assignment involved handling bounding boxes, a crucial image annotation technique widely used in deep learning for object detection tasks.
