# Character level language model - Dinosaurus Island
In this assignment, I built a character-level language model using an RNN to generate dinosaur names for researchers. I addressed the exploding gradient problem with gradient clipping, implemented a sampling function to generate names using softmax, and optimized the model with forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient updates via stochastic gradient descent. The model learned name patterns from a dinosaur dataset, and every 2000 iterations, it generated new names to demonstrate its progress. By the end, the model could create unique dinosaur names based on the learned patterns.
