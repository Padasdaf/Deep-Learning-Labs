# Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
In the "Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer" exercises, I implemented the neural style transfer algorithm by defining content, style, and total cost functions. Using a pre-trained VGG model, I extracted content and style representations from specific layers. The content cost measured how well the generated image matched the reference content, while the style cost captured the texture and style using Gram matrices. I then combined these costs and optimized the generated image using gradient descent, applying transfer learning to create new artistic images.
